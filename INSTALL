INSTALLATION
------------

Download the framework, extract it to the folder you would like to keep it in,
and add the library directory to your PHP include_path.

CONFIGURING THE INCLUDE PATH
----------------------------

Once you have a copy of MC Framework available, your application will need to
access the framework classes. Though there are several ways to achieve this, your
PHP include_path needs to contain the path to the MC Framework classes under the
/library directory in this distribution. You can find out more about the PHP
include_path configuration directive here:

http://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.include-path
