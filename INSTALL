INSTALLATION
------------

Download the framework, extract it to the folder you would like to keep it in,
and add the library directory to your PHP include_path.

* Using a Subversion (SVN) client. 

  Exporting is useful if you want to get a particular framework revision without the
  .svn  directories as created in a working copy.

  Checking out a working copy is necessary if you would like to directly contribute
  to MC Framework; a working copy can be updated any time with svn update.

  An externals definition is highly convenient for developers already using SVN to
  manage their application working copies.

CONFIGURING THE INCLUDE PATH
----------------------------

Once you have a copy of MC Framework available, your application will need to
access the framework classes. Though there are several ways to achieve this, your
PHP include_path needs to contain the path to the MC Framework classes under the
/library directory in this distribution. You can find out more about the PHP
include_path configuration directive here:

http://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.include-path
